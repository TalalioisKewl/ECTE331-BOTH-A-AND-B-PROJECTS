I might have messed up the file submission but you can fix it by exporting the file into eclipse  OR
Create a new Project with changing the names and class name and then saving it in a folder with the Rain.jpg file inside it.

Other than that the Wr.jpg file will be created.

RAW CODE is added just incase...
