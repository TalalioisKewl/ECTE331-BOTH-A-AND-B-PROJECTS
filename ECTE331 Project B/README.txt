The code works fine however in my end the RUN option needs to be spammed (clicked repetitively) in order for the
'Final Results' to be displayed. I tried to fix the problem using the internet but changing the code does not fix
or display results at all. 

This problem may not happen on your side. If it does occur just keep on clicking the RUN button and it will show. Please make
sure that you do not spam it a lot else it will display a memory error (not enough memory).

RAW CODE is added just incase...
